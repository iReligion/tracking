# project-tracking
PHP-based project tracking system. 

This was a PHP tool made by me in December of 2018 (back when I first started PHP).
This allowed me to provide clients with updates on their projects.

Very simple, and minimal CSS involved. This is just the core PHP project. This is extremely insecure and should not be used in a production setting. One day, I might return to this project and implement an actual login system and authorization/authentication for providing updates.
